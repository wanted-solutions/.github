## Organization Structure

### Owners

The owner of the `wanted-solutions` and `wanted-cloud` organizations is [WANTED.solutions s.r.o.](https://wanted.solutions) registered in the commercial register at City court in Prague, section C, entry 402081.

Owners have the highest level of administrative access and are responsible for the overall management and direction of the organization.

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the day-to-day management of specific projects within the organization. They have the authority to merge pull requests, manage issues, and make decisions about the project's direction.

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the projects by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or participating in discussions. Contributors do not have direct write access to the repositories.

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Based Decision Making

We strive to make decisions through consensus. This means that all maintainers should agree on a decision before it is implemented. If consensus cannot be reached, the decision will be escalated to the owners.

### Voting

In cases where consensus cannot be reached, a vote may be held among the maintainers. Each maintainer has one vote, and a simple majority is required to pass a decision. In the event of a tie, the decision will be escalated to the owners.

### Escalation

If a decision cannot be resolved through consensus or voting, it will be escalated to the owners. The owners will make the final decision.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the Code of Conduct will be addressed by the maintainers and may result in removal from the project.

### Pull Requests

Contributions should be submitted via pull requests. All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer before being merged. Pull requests should include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the changes
- Any relevant issue numbers
- Tests for new features or bug fixes

### Issue Management

Issues should be managed in a transparent and organized manner. Maintainers are responsible for triaging issues, assigning labels, and ensuring that issues are addressed in a timely manner.

## Meetings

Regular meetings will be held to discuss project status, upcoming features, and any issues that need to be addressed. Meeting notes will be documented and made available to the community.

## Communication

Communication should be conducted in a respectful and professional manner. We use the following channels for communication:

- GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

## Amendments

These governance guidelines may be amended by the owners. Proposed changes should be discussed with the maintainers and contributors before being implemented.
