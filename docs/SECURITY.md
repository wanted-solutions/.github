## Packages Versioning

All of our packages are using [`Semantic versiong`](https://semver.org/). We release patches for security vulnerabilities for all stable versions of our public packages, all repositories are also scanned for depedency vulnebraties continously. Vulnerable versions are marked as deprecated.

We will respond to your report within 72 hours with an acknowledgment and will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly. We ask that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.
